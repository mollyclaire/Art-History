                        <h4>Background Information</h4>
                        <p>The art movement referred to as "Dada" began around 1916 as a reaction to the horrors of WWI. Jean (Hans) Arp devoted himself to the arts in Zurich while "the guns rumbled in the distance." 
                        One of his pieces, <em>Collage with Squares Arranged According to the Laws of Chance</em>, became an iconic representation of Dada art in years to come. The artwork consists of fifteen
                        torn pieces of paper pasted onto a larger piece of paper. The collage symbolized the rejection of true "art" and the acceptance of chance. Apparently, Arp threw the smaller pieces of paper 
                        in the air and let them fall where they may. He felt liberated by the idea that his artistic intervention was removed from the work, and it's this free-spirited and avant-garde manner of thinking
                        that motivated most Dada artists.</p>
                        <h4>Instructions</h4>
                        <p>In this simple application, you will be able to generate a piece of art created with the same randomization and chance of Arp's work. Instead of throwing pieces of paper into the air, the computer 
                        randomly selects the shape and placement of a "piece of paper." As you engage with this game and create your own generative art pieces, consider why Dada artists might have rejected traditional ways of thinking about
                        and creating art during such a violent time period. Dwell on the similarities between technology today and the art of chance and autonomy during the Dada movement. And most importantly, have fun!
