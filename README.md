# Art-History
A collection of small applications that educate the user about art.

## Motivation
I've always loved fine art and have been interested in art history since I was a kid. I studied the subject at the University of Texas, and I've continued to educate myself through reading books and articles, taking online courses, and visiting museums across the country. 

When I decided to learn web development, I knew I would need to lift my head out of my beloved books about art historical methodologies and biographies about Kelly, Rothko, and van Gogh and devote my time to learning the lanuguages of the web. After spending months writing applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and now I have a new passion! 

In an effort to integrate these two interests of mine (art + computer programming), I've decided to create a series of web applications that center around art history. The two goals I have for this project include the challenge of finding associations between computer science and art and teaching users more about art. Check out the table of contents below to explore the applications in this series.
